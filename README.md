# MongoDB-Project
A MongoDB was set up to store data for a Ticket Management System. A range of CRUD operations were carried out on the database as well as aggregation. The database was migrated to the cloud using Mongo Atlas. The database contained three collections:
+ Customers
+ Orders
+ Tickets
